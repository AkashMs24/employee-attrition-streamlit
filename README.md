# Employee Attrition Prediction System 📊

A machine learning–based web application that predicts employee attrition risk and supports HR decision-making.

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Employee attrition leads to productivity loss and high replacement costs.  
This project helps HR teams identify employees at risk of leaving using historical data patterns.

## 🧠 Solution
A Random Forest classifier predicts attrition risk as a probability score rather than a binary output, enabling flexible decision thresholds.
